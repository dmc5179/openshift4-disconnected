== ServiceMesh

=== Requirements
Assumes you are running the playbook from a host that has a authenticated
session with appropriate permissions to install operators and setup
servicemesh.

Role Variables
--------------

This is an initial take with minimal to no role variables used.

This role should work for a regular OCP 4.x cluster and installs servicemesh.
There are no variables to customise the storage requirements for the some of
the servicemesh controlplane instances.

You will have to edit the yaml files where they are defined.

TODO: Should have role defaults for storage rquirements , so that it cab be
parameterised.
