#Note: oc-mirror v1 creates imageContentSource  # deprecatewd
#      oc-mirror v2 creates imageDigestSources  # GA in OCP 4.18
#      Use only one. imageDigestSources can still be used with oc-mirror v1, just a manual change

# Only choose one of imageContentSource or imageDigestSources below

#
# Note: oc mirror will create a file called imageContentSourcePolicy.yaml after pushing images to your private registry
# The mappings below can be found in that file and will already have the right registry name and location
# these are default examples for a command like
# oc-mirror --from <archive_dir> bastion.localdomain:5000

# Note that mirrorSourcePolicy is not respected by the openshift-installer
# I have submitted a BZ/RFE for this that is currently being worked.
# Adding that field now requires modifying the manifests that the openshift-installer
# creates pre-install
